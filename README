Set up a symbolic link from nbody.odocl to nbody.mllib (if it doesn't
exist).  Then the following "make" targets (which invoke ocamlbuild)
are available:

make doc: Make ocamldoc documentation (which will pretty much just
  contain the function signatures).

make lib: Make the library (which does not include the dFloat code or
  the omelyan code).

make clean: Clean up everything.
